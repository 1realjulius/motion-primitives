# Motion-Primitives

Beautifully designed motion components. Easy copy-paste. Customizable. Open Source. Built for engineers and designers.

Motion-Primitives is a project dedicated to showcasing animated components built with Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS. This repository offers a curated collection of reusable components designed to enhance your web applications or marketing websites with beautiful, smooth animations.

**The project is currently in beta. The code and styles of the components are subject to change as we continue to refine and improve the collection. We welcome your feedback and contributions to help make this project better.**

## Vision

As a developer keen on growing my skills in animation and motion design, I often found it challenging to find practical, high-quality code examples of animated components that were not just theoretical but also applicable to real-world projects. This gap inspired me to create Motion-Primitives.

### Bridge the gap

Provide ready-to-use, documented with examples, web animations that can be implemented and customized for various web projects.

### Learning by doing

Each component serves as a learning tool, enabling exploration of the capabilities and creative potential of motion within user interfaces.

### Community contribution

With an open-source approach, Motion-Primitives strives to build a diverse and rich collection of animated components that can be utilized by anyone in the development and design community.

### Unstyled

Each components starts with a styled version, but the ultimate goal is to find a way to provide an unstyled version that can be easily integrated into any project.
