# Dialog

A dialog that smoothly transitions content into a focused view using layout animations. It's perfect for showcasing details like images and texts in a more prominent, centered overlay. The dialog is easy to manage with click-outside and escape key functionalities to close.

<ComponentCodePreview component={<Dialog />} filePath="core/dialog" />
